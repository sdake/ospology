      * Ana will help ask Hilary for any updates of the process
* What are the specific challenges of building an OSPO in Asia regions compared to Europe or US OSPOs? 
    * Similar to Europe, everything is in a really early state. No necessarily calling them and OSPO but something similar and are specific with licensing, security and compliance. But lack of things related to the community.
    * Example: People in India are trained in compliance. Similar issue.
    * Example: One ospo responsibility: making developers contribute more falling under license compliance team
    * Cultural difference is a huge challenge, it’s hard to make Asia participants take the first the step
    * C-level managers don’t really understand the value of contributing upstream. This might be a big issue to prevent an org to continue this
    * Briefly mentioned this tool: https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort 
    * Lack of open source culture (people are afraid to adopt open source in the sense that this would be “free”)
* Could courses be better integrated as an internal open source training process of an organization to ease open source culture education and OS 101? Is this something organizations in Asia use and see value?
    * Training courses could be targeted to specific countries, knowing the context of each country.
* How to convince c-level in Asia regions
    * Writing open source as a business tool (targeted to c-level executive)
    * Different regions interact differently with middle management
    * Big important for local people to scale within the org.
    * Knowing the context for each region is key. For instance, how to train people in the western regions vs asia regions is
    * Local ambassadors who understand the languages are crucial. We need liaisons.
