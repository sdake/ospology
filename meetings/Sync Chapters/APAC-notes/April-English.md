## Meeting notes:

* How is the OSPO adoption China?

  * Different culture between China and USA/EU. Traditionally OSS was only used but now they also contribute back to the community. China has not so much impact on 
the community compared to EU/USA, part to language barrier but more the issue is culture. Joined to group as we are willing to upstream and contribute so we can bring 
this learning back. 

  * From TODO group we see a lot of APAC companies starting their OSPO with license compliance is the same in China?
  * In China open source is mostly done by computer science and not legal - these two fields are quite separate and eager to connect and learn 
Under TOD
  * Under OpenChain there is the Reference Tooling Group see https://oss-compliance-tooling.org/ which has bi-weekly calls on 10 AM CEST and 6 PM CEST where several OSPO member share knowledge regarding compliance 
  * TODO recently created an OSPO mindmap to show breadth of topic an OSPOCon work on see https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-mindmap/Img/initial-mindmap.pdf

  * There is an OSPOCon in Japan this year on December 5-6 see https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/about/ospocon/ It would be great if people in this call submit talks to share their OSPO knowledge and best pratices, see for example this OSPOCon US talk - A Decade of Open Source in China - Insights Report with Chinese OSPO's Best Practices - Wei Wang, ECNU & Rong Wang, Alibaba Group
  * Would be great if we could set up an OSPOCon next year in China to spread OSPO knowledge incl. best practices and tooling.

* Is there any Academic research related to OSPO?
  * Yes, there is see for example https://github.com/todogroup/opensource-research or research papers from Prof Dirk Riehle on https://dirkriehle.com/ 
  * There is also the TODOâ€™ OSPO Survey and work is on the way to get more participants from China. Ana says she also working on getting more organizations from EU to join.

* When is the next TODO APAC meeting
  * Please see the calendar on https://todogroup.org/community/
